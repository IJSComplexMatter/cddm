Introduction
============

``cddm`` is a package for analysis of cross-differential dynamic microscopy experiments
and for standard DDM experiments. It consists of tools for the analysis of regular
or irregular time-spaced data. The package is hosted at GitHub `repository`_.

License
-------

``cddm`` will be released under MIT license so you will be able to use it freely, however, I will ask you to cite the *... some future paper*. In the mean time you can play with the current development version freely, but i kindly ask you not to redistribute the code or  publish data obtained with this package. **Please wait until the package is officially released!**

Highlights
----------

* Easy-to-use interface.
* Efficient computation (numba optimized), multitau algorithm
* In-memory and out-of-memory computation of cross- auto-correlation functions
* Data visualizer, and k-averaging

   
Status and limitations
----------------------

``cddm`` is a young (experimental) project. The package was developed mainly for calculation of cross correlation function in cross-DDM experiment, but it can be used
for standard DDM analysis. The package is fully operational. Currently, the work is focused on documenting the package and working on examples, tutorials and building  unittests.
