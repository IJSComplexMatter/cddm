# cddm examples

In the root directory and plots/ there are scripts to generate plots for the sphinx documentation. See these first, then go through more advanced examples in other folders

You can tune the parameters in conf.py, or in conf.py files in subfolders.

The examples are structured as python packages, but you can run them individually from package root directory or from sub-directories.

Some examples rely on data generated from other examples (indicated in docstrings of each of the examples), so make sure you read the documentation before running the files.
